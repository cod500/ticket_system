## Reflection

- I could not find a task tracker that had the features that I wanted such as how long it took me to solve each problem so i decided to create my own. It turned out to be a fantastic learning experience with technologies I have only sparingly used before such as EJS, and the PostgreSQL.

- I used 100% CSS of my own with no help from thrid party libraries for styling or responsiveness. JQuery was slightly used with Ajax calls. 

- I had some challenges with styling for mobile devices and the creating of the notifiation feature. The notification uses logic through EJS to load new tickets and submitted tickets rendered through the get request on the home page. Getting the notification icon to turn red on new tickets and back to white when they were cleared to some trial and error. 

-Several technologies I learn and practiced with:
   - Node.js
   - REST APIs
   - EJS
   - PostgreSQL
   - Passport
